        <p>Its is extremely popular to use, due to its power and simplicity, especially when most of the data-entry is taken care of automatically for you by the banks</p>

        <p>The Store platforms I recommend (Shopify, Tradevine, TradeMe) combine to seamlessly integrate into Xero, creating and updating invoices and transactions so you don't have to</p>

        <p>Many of the business and marketing sites I build don't need to be running on expensive servers &amp; databases, but many web developers will give that to you because its all they know.</p>

        <p>I believe in using the right tools for the job, and if content isn't changing every day, then static sites running of Github Pages or other providers are a fantastic offering</p>

        <p>There are no databases to worry about, your sites run faster - which can lead to higher placement on Google, and costs go way down</p>

        <p>The BlackCedar site is exactly that.  It costs $0 per month in hosting and databases, because of the technology choices made, leaving me to sleep easy.</p>
